# Flight_Radar
Hello, this project is a flight radar application developed using React Toolkit and Redux Thunk. The project displays live flights over the location entered by the user, using flight data from the Flight-radar API via RapidAPI. The Leaflet library is used for map rendering. The project offers two main pages to track flights: a map page and a list page. Users can access flight details from both pages.
